The JS Conformance framework is a part of the Closure Compiler that allows developers to specify a configuration for automatically checking compiled code that it conforms to certain requirements, such as forbidding access to a certain property or calls to a certain function. This can be useful for forbidding bad code from entering a code base, such as use of insecure DOM APIs (like innerHTML or eval) or deprecated code. More information can be found in the [JS Conformance Documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13Zx-p-GmgPIEig26dFV4Iy9u6wTOLem8o7ScaqT66lA/view).
