# Status of ES6 support in Closure Compiler

# Introduction

There are major changes in store for EcmaScript 6 and will require major changes to Closure Compiler to support it.

This is a place to collect changes that will need to be made to the compiler.

## Overview

Summary: https://github.com/lukehoban/es6features

Spec: http://people.mozilla.org/~jorendorff/es6-draft.html

# Details

## Parser

The new parser is in place, and has replaced the old Rhino parser. It understands all ES6 features though there may still be a few bugs here and there.

## Transpilation

We support transpilation of the following ES6 features down to ES5/3.

* let/const
* arrow functions
* default parameters and rest ("...") parameters in functions
* The spread ("...") operator in function calls and array literals
* Classes (ES6 classes will be @struct by default. You can add @unrestricted to override that behavior. See the 'JSDoc Tag Reference' section of the [Google JS style guide](https://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/javascriptguide.xml) for information about the @struct annotation.)
* Computed properties and short properties in object literals.
* Method declarations in object literals (though the 'super' keyword will not work, currently)
* "for of" loops
* generator functions
* template strings
* Better unicode escapes in string literals (e.g. "\u{1F436}" == "üê∂")
* destructuring assignment
* modules

## Type Checking

Type checking is currently done on "transpiled" code.  Direct support will happen after the new type inference is stable.

## Optimizations

Optimization currently occur on "transpiled" code.  Direct support will happen after the "check" phase understands ES6.

## Code Printer

The code printer should at this point support all of ES6
